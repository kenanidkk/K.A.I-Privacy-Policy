Privacy Policy for K.A.I & K.A.I Unleashed
Last updated: August 10th, 2025

1. Information We Collect
The Bots only collect and store the minimal data necessary to provide their features:

Leveling System Data: Discord User IDs, associated XP, and the Server ID where the XP was earned. This is stored permanently and cannot be manually deleted.

Moderation Command Data: Information explicitly provided when using moderation commands (e.g., reasons for bans, report messages, or other input you submit).

No other command usage logs or message histories are stored beyond what is necessary for these features.

2. How We Use Your Data
Your data is used solely to:

Track and display your progress in the leveling system per server.

Process and record moderation actions (e.g., bans, reports).

3. Data Sharing and Security
I do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third parties.

All stored data is kept secure and accessible only to me (Discord: kenanidk).

4. Data Retention
Leveling System Data: Stored permanently and cannot be removed upon request.

Moderation Command Data: Kept only as long as needed for server moderation purposes.

5. Third-Party Services
The Bots may interact with third-party APIs (e.g., Reddit, IMDb, Fortnite APIs) to retrieve information, but this data is not stored or linked to individual users.

6. Changes to Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the Bots after changes means you accept the updated policy.
8. Contact
For privacy-related questions, contact me on Discord: kenanidk.
